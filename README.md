For technical elements, TBH is a combination of View layers (ZStack, HStack, VStack, NavigationView and NavigationStack), each layer is a mix of using color pallete, shape, text and button. Moreover, the MapKit library is used to embed the Apple Map which respect to the instance location. These used elements are guaranteed to fall in scope week 1 to 5 of the course.
In terms of design layout, TBH is organised in three main views (Welcome view, List view and Detail view) along with some component views. The Welcome View is what user will see after opening the app, then it drive to the List view where a catalog of objects (Baker shop) is provided. As soon as user click into one of the displayed
shops, they are driven to a Detail view, which gives a set of descripted information such as shop name, category, story, opening hours and location map
